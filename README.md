# HNG Task 0 - Mobile App

## Overview
This is a mobile application developed using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native. The application serves as a task submission for the HNG internship program. It includes navigation to relevant links such as the GitHub repository and HNG hire page. The app features a simple UI with a responsive design and an animated fade-in effect.

## Features
- **Expo-based React Native App**: Built with `create-expo-app` for ease of development and deployment.
- **Professional UI**: Styled with the HNG brand colors (`#00aeff` and white) for consistency and aesthetic appeal.
- **Smooth Animations**: Uses `Animated` API for a fade-in effect on app launch.
- **Navigation Links**: Provides direct access to the GitHub repository and HNG hire page.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Designed to be fully responsive and work seamlessly across different screen sizes.
